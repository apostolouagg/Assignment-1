#Assignment #1

This is a game made with C#. A die changes positions randomly within a panel. The goal of the game is for the player to collect as many points as possible. Each time the die is clicked, the player receives from 1 to 6 points. The points obtained each time are equal to the number shown on the die at that moment.

Initially, the user must Log In or Register with their details. After logging in, they are directed to the main menu where their details and the Leaderboard are displayed.

By clicking Play, the player is directed to the corresponding form and can start the game. They must first select the level, and then the game starts whenever they click the die.

In Account settings, the user can change the Theme of the application, see their personal scores on each level, and change their profile picture.

In the Leaderboard, the order of appearance of the players is determined by their score. Obviously, the player with the highest score is first, the next highest is second, and so on. The user can view the Leaderboard for each level using the Easy, Medium, or Hard buttons.
