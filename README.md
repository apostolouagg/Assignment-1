# Assignment #1

This is a game made with C#. A dice changes positions randomly within a panel. The goal of the game is for the player to collect as many points as possible. Each time the dice is clicked, the player receives from 1 to 6 points. The points obtained each time are equal to the number shown on the dice at that moment.

Initially, the user must <b>Log In</b> or <b>Register</b> with their details. After logging in, they are directed to the main menu where their details and the Leaderboard are displayed.

By clicking <b>Play</b> , the player is directed to the corresponding form and can start the game. They must first select the level, and then the game starts whenever they click the dice.

In <b>Account settings</b>, the user can change the Theme of the application, see their personal scores on each level, and change their profile picture.

In the <b>Leaderboard</b>, the order of appearance of the players is determined by their score. Obviously, the player with the highest score is first, the next highest is second, and so on. The user can view the Leaderboard for each level using the <b>Easy</b>, <b>Medium</b>, or <b>Hard</b> buttons.

All data is stored in txt files.
